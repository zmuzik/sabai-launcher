Sabai Launcher
==============
Android (Nougat) stock app launcher optimized for single-handed use.
* Swipe down anywhere on the screen to show notifications. No need to reach the top of the screen by your thumb.
* Swipe up on the bottom favorites row to show all installed apps. Swipe in the central part opens the list in full screen. Swipe on the left or right part opens a smaller list, easier to reach by your thumb when using the device by a single hand.
